Unsupported parameters for a given kind of archive
==================================================

Given the very nature of the different kind of archive formats, some parameters are not supported for a given archive type (e.g for a bzip2 file, original rights and mode of the file inside the archive are not saved). An explicit warning will appear in the backup checker log file if you are using an unsupported feature for a given type of archive.
